## What are Conversational Models?

Conversational models are AI-powered systems that use natural language processing (NLP) to simulate human-like conversations. They can process inputs, understand context, and generate responses

## Evaluation Metrics --->

# BLEU:

A precision-based metric that measures the quality of text generated by a model. It was originally designed for language translation, but can also be used for text summarization and generation.

# ROUGE:

A recall-based metric that measures the overlap between an output text and a reference text.

# Extrinsic metrics:

Measure how well a system performs tasks like answering queries, sentiment analysis, and generating reports.

# User experience and usability:

How intuitive and responsive the model is.

# Resolution rates:

How often a chatbot can resolve queries without human help.

# Bounce rate:

The number of users who visit a platform but leave without communicating with the chatbot.

# Intent recognition:

How well a chatbot understands user intent and generates human-like responses.

# User satisfaction:

How satisfied users are with the system.
